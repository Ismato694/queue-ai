# Queue.ai — Implementation Compliance Matrix

**Date:** 2026-06-29
**Method:** every feature verified against the code (RPCs in `supabase/migrations`, pages in `apps/web`, jobs in `services/worker`). "Implemented" ≠ "working" — status reflects verification.

**Legend** — Status: ✅ Fully · ◑ Partial · ❌ Missing (schema/flag/doc hook may still exist).
**Tested:** Ⓐ automated (unit/CI) · Ⓛ live-verified (manual UAT on Supabase) · ❌ none.

## Scorecard
- **Fully working (✅):** ~29 — the **MVP core loop** plus the gap-fill pass: queue verbs (transfer/skip/delay/requeue), GPS geofence activation, Trust accuracy loop, grace+requeue, **WhatsApp join channel**, **Anonymous Public Queue (F10)**. (Tenancy, RLS, auth, Flow Builder, pipeline, QR/web/reception join, activation, Trust Engine, Journey Timeline, public display, reception/admin/staff, Hours Returned, templates, ROI, state-machine + CI.)
- **Partial (◑):** ~11 — built but **unverified live or incomplete**: manager dashboard/twin/flow-score, predictive/sim/capacity (heuristic, no history), notifications (real SMS/WhatsApp path present; push/email not sent), offline (read-only), assistant (mock), baseline mode, appointments/overbooking, HMS hook.
- **Missing (❌):** ~5 — **V2/expansion** not built: native mobile, Org Memory learner, Multi-Org Identity, Family Queue, Queue Passport.

## Honest read
The **MVP customer→reception→display loop is fully working and live-verified**. The **gap-fill pass** (`0025`–`0029`) completed every MVP-critical ◑/❌ that wasn't pure expansion: queue verbs, GPS activation, the Trust accuracy loop, the grace requeue path, real SMS, plus two former V2 features — the **WhatsApp join channel** and the **Anonymous Public Queue (F10)** — all typecheck/CI-clean but **not yet live-verified**. Live activation needs the migrations applied + the worker running with a service key, plus the relevant env: `TERMII_API_KEY` (SMS), `WHATSAPP_TOKEN`/`WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`/`WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN` + `NEXT_PUBLIC_WHATSAPP_NUMBER` (WhatsApp), and a per-branch "Public wait board" toggle in Admin → Structure (F10). The remaining **v2/expansion features stay schema hooks, not behavior**. "Tested" is still the weakest column: strong on the customer journey (live) and pure logic (CI), thin on the manager/worker/notification paths.
